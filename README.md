# Pot odds calculator for PokerNow.club

Have you ever found yourself playing poker on [Poker Now](https://www.pokernow.club), and wishing you had realtime pot odds? Well, look no further. This Chrome Extension adds a real-time pot odds calculator to the display, showing pot odds for every decision (yours and other players).

## "What are pot odds", you ask? 

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot_odds): 

> In poker, pot odds are the ratio of the current size of the pot to the cost of a contemplated call. Pot odds are often compared to the probability of winning a hand with a future card in order to estimate the call's expected value.

You can use pot odds to help you decide whether to call, raise or fold, by comparing the pot odds to the odds of making your hand.

## Is it safe?

Yes. This extension doesn't send any data off-site, nor does it look at your cards. The calculation is based purely on the bet size and pot value - it has nothing to do with cards, card values, or your opponents moves.

## How does it work?

Once you've installed the Chrome extension, you'll see a small "Pot odds" box appear at all times. The odds are expressed as a fraction of `1.0`. You can see a screenshot below, with the added feature highlighted in pink:
